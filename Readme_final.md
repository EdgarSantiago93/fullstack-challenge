## Development process

As I've mentioned on one of the interviews, I like to be thorough in any project.

These are the steps I followed to complete the challenge:

- It had been some time since I had developed in React, so I did some research on new practices and new features, mainly regarding the ```functions over classes``` approach,  consulted with friends on some issues I was having and finally, taking a crash course in advanced react.

- I started to plan all the components that I'd need for the final app, and did some research on the company, this lead me to a [video](https://vimeo.com/404406126) published by Raphael on vimeo, which gave me a general look and feel of what you were, maybe, expecting.

- I adapted several assets from that video, including the gif loader.

- I tried to create a familiar and pleasant UI experience.

- Once I had finished the main task, I decided to implement a small dashboard, this is because, in one of the i nterviews, John asked me if I had some examples of data displaying.

- I searched online for some open data and stumbled upon a JSON file containing the population stats from Switzerland, which I then uploaded to a personal server so that I could fetch the information.


## Puntos?

I took a more dashboardy approach, so, tables.

I completed the task required for the challenge and after, I decided to

## Final thoughts


Even though the challenge was simple in a technical way, it presented a challenge for me in another level.

I had a lot of fun re-learning some front end concepts, it had been some time since I had a challenge, and this simple test gave me one. 

It forced me to [improvise, adapt and to overcome](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/14bfd841d1b56eb71dda535bbc9dfc3b.jpg)


## Setting it up

This project uses the bare minimum for deployment, so a ```npm install``` & ```npm start``` npm  should do the trick.


```{.bash}
cd fullstack-challenge
npm install
```

After that start the development server and the test api server(run each
command in a separate terminal session, I recommend using tmux)

```{.bash}
npm start
```
